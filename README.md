> End-to-end explainable framework that converts demand signals into operationally trusted flight capacity decisions

## 📌 Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end, explainable framework that converts demand signals into operationally trusted flight capacity decisions for the FedEx Tricolor Challenge. Instead of optimizing demand forecasts in isolation, the solution focuses on bridging the gap between planning and execution—a key challenge in large logistics networks such as FedEx.

The framework ensures that demand forecasts are treated as **inputs, not capacity targets**, and that capacity allocation reflects cost exposure, delay risk, and operational flexibility. The solution prioritizes **interpretability, realism, and decision scalability** over black-box accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional forecast-driven planning often leads to:
- **White-tail capacity** from over-commitment
- **Load factor mismatch** between planned and actual utilization
- **Increased delay risk** on fragile routes
- **One-size-fits-all** utilization targets

### Objective
Design a framework that converts demand forecasts into risk-aware, cost-aware capacity decisions, reducing planning-execution gaps without adding flights.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

The solution is structured into two integrated segments:

### Segment 1 — Explainable Demand Forecasting (Round-02)
- **Signal-aware, regression-based forecasting**
- **Demand decomposed into:**
  - Base demand
  - Promotion-driven volatility
  - Sentiment and sustainability alignment
- **Forecasts include confidence and stability indicators**

### Segment 2 — Capacity Decision Framework (Round-03)
- **Rule-based, explainable capacity logic** (no black-box optimization)
- **Capacity decisions governed by a 4-Factor Decision Lens:**
  - Demand Stability
  - Cost Exposure (Fixed vs Variable)
  - Delay Risk
  - Real-Time Flexibility

### 🔑 Key Insight
**Two routes with identical demand forecasts may require opposite capacity decisions.**

## 📊 Synthetic Dataset Design

### Why Synthetic Data?
No official dataset was provided. To ensure realism and explainability, domain-informed synthetic datasets were created to reflect real-world logistics behavior while enabling controlled experimentation.

### Dataset 1 — Customer SKU Demand Signals
**File**: `customer_sku_demand_signals.csv`  
**Purpose**: Capture customer-level demand drivers and volatility

**Key Features**:
- `base_demand` — organic demand baseline
- `promotion_flag`, `discount_percentage` — short-term demand shocks
- `sentiment_score`, `review_volume` — digital perception signals
- `sustainable_sku_flag`, `eco_preference_index` — long-term demand stability
- `regulation_impact_score` — regulatory influence

### Dataset 2 — Forecasted Demand Output
**File**: `forecasted_demand_output.csv`  
**Purpose**: Store model-generated, time-bound demand forecasts used directly for capacity planning

**Outputs**:
- `forecasted_demand`
- `forecast_confidence`

### Dataset 3 — Tricolor Flight Capacity Metadata
**File**: `tricolor_flight_capacity.csv`  
**Purpose**: Represent FedEx-like operational constraints

**Key Features**:
- `max_capacity`
- `fixed_cost`
- `variable_cost_per_unit`
- `real_time_update_flag`
- `delay_risk_score`

### Dataset 4 — Round-03 Capacity Decisions (FINAL OUTPUT)

**Purpose**: Contains route-level capacity strategy decisions generated using the 4-Factor Decision Lens

**Key Columns**:
- `route`
- `forecasted_demand`
- `max_capacity`
- `demand_stability`
- `cost_profile`
- `delay_risk_flag`
- `flexibility_flag`
- `utilization_strategy`
- `planning_comment`

**This file represents the final operational output of the project.**

## ⚙️ Modeling & Decision Logic

### Demand Forecasting (Segment 1)
- **Model**: Regression-based, interpretable
- **Goal**: Explain why demand changes, not just how much

### Capacity Decision Logic (Segment 2)

| Route Characteristics | Capacity Strategy |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Stable demand + High fixed cost | Maximize utilization |
| Volatile demand + Real-time flexibility | Dynamic buffer |
| High delay risk | Conservative loading |
| Low cost + Flexible operations | Absorb uncertainty |

**We do not change demand forecasts — we change how much we trust them operationally.**

## 📈 Business Impact

- ✅ **Reduced white-tail capacity** through targeted utilization
- ✅ **Improved alignment** between planned and actual load factors
- ✅ **Lower delay risk** on fragile routes
- ✅ **Explicit trade-offs** between cost, risk, and reliability
- ✅ **Scalable framework** applicable across the Tricolor network

### Executive Insight
*For FedEx, the cost of being wrong on a high-risk route is higher than flying slightly empty — and this framework makes that trade-off explicit.*

**Built with 📊 for bridging the gap between demand forecasting and operational capacity decisions in large-scale logistics networks**: FedEx Demand Forecasting and Capacity Optimization

## Overview

This project addresses a logistics competition challenge by developing an end-to-end solution for demand forecasting and capacity optimization in a FedEx-like operational context. In the absence of an official dataset, we engineered domain-informed synthetic datasets that simulate real-world logistics, demand signals, and operational constraints. Our approach prioritizes explainability, business realism, and actionable decision-making over black-box accuracy, enabling FedEx to leverage digital technologies for optimized capacity planning, cost control, and enhanced customer experience.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Opsium_Notebook.ipynb`) and utilizes three custom synthetic datasets stored in the `data/` directory. Our methodology combines regression-based demand forecasting with rule-based capacity optimization logic to deliver interpretable, decision-focused analytics.

## Dataset Creation Methodology

### Why Synthetic Data?

No official dataset was provided for this challenge. To address this, we designed domain-informed synthetic datasets that closely mimic real-world logistics, demand, and operational behavior while allowing controlled experimentation and explainability.

### Dataset 1: Customer SKU Demand Signals (`customer_sku_demand_signals.csv`)

**Purpose:**  
Capture factors that influence customer-level demand.

**How it was created:**  
- Generated customer–SKU–route combinations across monthly time periods  
- Assigned a stable `base_demand` to represent organic demand  
- Introduced controlled variability using business signals  

**Key Features & Logic:**  
- `promotion_flag`, `discount_percentage` → Introduced short-term demand uplift and volatility  
- `sentiment_score`, `review_volume` → Modeled digital perception and confidence in demand  
- `sustainable_sku_flag`, `eco_preference_index` → Represented long-term demand shifts driven by sustainability  
- `regulation_impact_score` → Modeled regulatory pressure influencing demand behavior  

All signals were generated within realistic ranges and designed to interact logically with demand rather than randomly.

### Dataset 2: Forecasted Demand Output (`forecasted_demand_output.csv`)

**Purpose:**  
Store model-generated demand forecasts used as direct input to capacity planning.

**How it was created:**  
- Applied a regression-based forecasting approach  
- Combined:  
  - Historical base demand  
  - Promotion & discount effects  
  - Sentiment strength and review confidence  
  - Sustainability and regulatory alignment  

The result is time-bound, signal-aware forecasted demand at SKU and route levels.

### Dataset 3: Tricolor Flight Capacity Data (`tricolor_flight_capacity.csv`)

**Purpose:**  
Represent FedEx operational constraints and decision variables.

**How it was created:**  
- Defined major Tricolor routes  
- Assigned realistic operational parameters:  
  - `fixed_cost` (aircraft, crew, lease)  
  - `variable_cost_per_unit` (fuel, handling)  
  - `real_time_update_flag` (digital readiness)  
  - `delay_risk_score` (operational reliability)  
  - `capacity` (maximum flight load)  

This dataset enables capacity optimization and pricing decisions driven by forecasted demand.

## Modeling Approach

### Demand Forecasting (Segment 1)

**Model Type:** Regression-based forecasting (signal-aware)  

**Inputs:**  
- Historical demand + promotions + sentiment + sustainability + regulation  

**Output:**  
- Forecasted demand by SKU, route, and time period  

**Goal:**  
- Explain why demand changes, not just how much  

### Capacity Optimization Logic (Segment 2)

No black-box optimization was used. Instead, we applied rule-based, explainable decision logic:  

- Compare forecasted demand vs capacity  
- Adjust decisions using:  
  - Fixed vs variable cost trade-offs  
  - Delay risk constraints  
  - Real-time update flexibility  

Generate recommendations for:  
- Capacity scaling  
- Pricing controls  
- Buffer allocation  
- Risk mitigation
